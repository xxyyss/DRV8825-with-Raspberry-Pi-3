DRV8825-with-Raspberry-Pi-3
---------------------------

**Python 3 script running under raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 3 for testing or controlling a DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver with reading of the fault output.**


----------


Actually this script was likely written for educational and testing purpose only.
Now I want to share and improve the script for people who have no idea how to control the DRV8825 bipolar stepper motor driver with it's step/dir interface and a raspberry pi 3

**Features:**

- Output of hardware PWM for the step-pin
- Reading output of the fault pin and give out errors (needs improvement)
- Choosing in and output pin as well as frequency and duty cycle userfriendly

**Planned:**

- Choosing direction of the motor
- Creating a full tutorial for the Driver and the Raspberry out of this
